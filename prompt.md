I'm building a web application for a sales management system called Tech R Us. The core entities are Customers, Products, Sales, SalesDetails, SalesAssociates, and Manufacturers. I need a React frontend app where each entity has its own page with a table listing all records, a form to add a new record, and edit/delete options for entries. For foreign keys (like ManufacturerID in Products, or CustomerID/AssociateID in Sales), use dropdowns that fetch related records from the backend. Assume the backend is built with Express and has REST endpoints for each CRUD operation, but do not write any SQL or database setup—just generate the React components/pages, basic routing, and fetch requests to the API.
